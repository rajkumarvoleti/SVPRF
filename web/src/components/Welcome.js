          in-house technology. We provide our clients with the tools and
          technology they need to assess the current situation and make quick

          translate their political vision into policies and actions to bring
          about desired improvements in the real world is known as public
          policy. The ‘real environment' is rapidly evolving, which has resulted
          in a push for more evidence-based policy development and
          implementation
